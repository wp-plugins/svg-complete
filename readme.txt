== Description ==
This plugin adds some SVG functionality to your WordPress and uses a SVG technique that's based on an idea by Alexey Ten. This way of including SVG images into HTML seems to be the one with the best combination of performance and compatibility at the moment.
Upload SVG files to your WordPress and add them to your post or pages via the SVG button in your visual editor. Here you can even select to have zoom and pan (mouse drag) on your svg, useful for maps for example. You can also set image size, a fallback image and an alt text for SEO
  
List of Features:  
  
* Upload SVG files to your media library
* Use SVG files via a TinyMCE bytton or by shortcode in your posts or pages
* Option to set zoom and drag on svg images (by mouse and buttons)
* Option to set a CSS class
* Option to define a fallback image (usually PNG) for your SVG
* Option to add alt-information for SEO
